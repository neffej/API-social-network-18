## Description
This project is intended to create connections for people to share thoughts and reactions across the web.  It can be used in any application that would benefit from a social connection aspect, and can be tailored to fit individual needs.  Apart from that, it is a useful foray into MongoDB and Mongoose and is a useful as a learning tool for improving one's database management skills.

## Installation
This project runs on Node.js, Express and Mongoose.  Please ensure that you have these three technologies and MongoDB installed on your local computer. Express and Mongoose are NPM packages - simply type npm i express/mongoose in your command line to install the packages. Once your technologies are installed, open the server.js in your CLI and enter node server.js.

## Usage
Follow the above steps. Once your server is connected, you can connect to the localhost at the port location (default 3001) and send requests to the server in the appropriate format. Please check with the models and controllers files to ensure you are sending the proper information to achieve your goals.
